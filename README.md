## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to use the dataset to find a trend in the Australian weather. Having a decade worth of data will let us understand the impact of global warming on the Australian climate, this will be reflected in other observations in this dataset. This dataset can be a strong example of global warming and the effects of it on a more macro-environment. Although it can be said that there are thousands of examples that come to the same conclusion as ours, an increase in the quantity of these examples serve to strengthen the voice of scientific reasoning all around the world, resulting in a push for more environmental policies to prevent further global warming.
Things that we want to explore in this dataset mostly relate to temperature change, the relation of the temperature change over time, rate of change of the temperature relative to human perception and comparison. Other things we wish to find out is whether or not there was an increase in the precipitation as a result of global warming, and how the deserts in Australia change over the decade of observations. 
A dashboard of how parameters have changed over time. Such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind. An interesting expansion on the dashboard can be to describe the climate differences across different regions in Australia. Describing regions with probabilities of all parameters based of the past data. For example, regions close to the deserts will have a smaller probability of rainfall and humidity compared to an ocean. Although this data would be too old for modern use it can be reused with newer data.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we have chosen is provided by the Australian Government’s Bureau of Meteorology. The dataset contains ten years (2008 to mid-2017,) of daily weather observations from many locations in Australia. The data consists of many different measurements that were measured at two different times of the day. The purpose of the dataset was for meteorologist to predict the weather forecast of the following day. In the data set, the variable, RainTomorrow, was the goal for meteorologist to determine if the rain for the following day was 1mm or more. The data is from the Beaure of Meteorology’s “real time” system. This system collects data from different weather stations that are located all across the country at a automated schedule.
